INDEX:
1. 2016-09-28 Create new repo on Lunar Note Web Portal.
2. The folder template and static is part of the framework for spring boot starter. For those pages in static, you can visit by typing the name directly; but for pages in templates, they can only access by controller and the name shows in url bar would be the RequestMapping name like "login" but not "enquiry.html" (because login is like an instance made according to template "enquiry.html")
3. So this explain why the template cannot call each other with a href inside. It is because template is not able to call another template, only instances can call or do other action.
4. Upcoming todo:
    * unit test for AS400Toolkit
	* feature out how to request for 2 para in controller request mapping
	* feature out how to switch from enquiry to modify
